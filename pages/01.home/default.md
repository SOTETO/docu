# Heureka!
## Collaboration based on services

Welcome to the microservice infrastructure that implements the basics for a full integrated collaboration suite fitting your needs! Using a collaboration software always binds your organization to the maintaining software vendor. Although the advent of Open Source software in the 1990s allows to share the burden of maintaining software, most organizations require such specifc collaboration features and the consideration of organizational internal knowledge and structures. Heureka! addresses this challenges by allowing you to setup your own environment and integrate features specifc to your organization that are implemented by software vendors you choose. You can bring together the expertize and experiences of different vendors without a large software project, but many small and distinct ones. You will be able to manage, improve and adjust your work environment as you need it!

If you are a software developer, you will see that you can use your existing expertize regarding technologies and technical environments to implement features requested by a client. The Heureka! architecture comes with an existing user management and solves problems as [user session management](../architecture/shared-session) or the [integration of UI elements in existing other microservices or existing UI elements in your new service](../architecture/dUIfc). Use the Heureka! architecture to responsible only for the services of your own development. Solutions for non-functional requirements or other services used by your client are maintained by others. Thus, you can stay focused and improve what really matters.

!!!! Getting started by pulling the [Heureka! CLI](https://github.com/SOTETO/heureka?target=_blank) and reading its [readme](https://github.com/SOTETO/heureka#readme?target=_blank) to setup your Heureka! environment! [How To create a microservice](../how-to/create-a-microservice) explains in detail the setup to start implementing your first microservice.
